# DDoS-Attack-Detection-in-SDN-using-Entropy

## About the Project
There are a lot of security threats in the Software Defined Networks. We will be dealing with Distributed Denial-Of-Service in this project work as a result of these 
security concerns. When a large number of packets are forwarded to a network device with an intent to either stop the service or decrease the performance then such 
attacks are termed  as Distributed Denial-of-service attacks.  
Sample entropy, a general method for DDoS detection in SDN, is conducted by collecting the flow statistics or traffic features from the switches, and calculating the 
entropy measure randomness in the packets that are coming to a network. The higher the randomness, the higher is the entropy and vice versa. By setting a threshold, 
if the entropy passes it or below it, depending on the scheme, an attack is detected.

## Built With
- Linux 
- Python
- Mininet
- POX
- Scapy
- Spear

## Future Scope
Having addressed the problem of detection of attack on the network, Mitigation of the Distributed Denial-of-Service attack in the SDN environment will be the next
task in our project. It can be implemented with an efficient algorithm using OpenFlow entries.
